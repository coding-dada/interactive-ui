## Key Components

### SplineScene

The `SplineScene` component integrates with Spline to render interactive 3D models:

```tsx
<SplineScene 
  scene="https://prod.spline.design/kZDDjO5HuC9GJUM2/scene.splinecode"
  className="w-full h-full"
/>
```

### Spotlight

The `Spotlight` component creates a dynamic light effect that follows the user's cursor:

```tsx
<Spotlight
  className="md:left-60"
  size={700}
/>
```

## Customization

### Modifying the 3D Scene

To use a different 3D model, replace the `scene` URL in the `SplineScene` component with your own Spline scene URL.

### Adjusting the Spotlight

The spotlight effect can be customized by modifying the following properties:

- `size`: Controls the size of the spotlight (default: 700px)
- `className`: Additional CSS classes for positioning and styling

## Troubleshooting

### Hydration Errors

If you encounter hydration errors with the Spotlight component, ensure that:

1. The component is properly client-side rendered with the 'use client' directive
2. Initial state values match between server and client rendering
3. DOM manipulation only occurs after component mounting

### 3D Scene Loading Issues

If the 3D scene fails to load:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify that the Spline scene URL is correct and accessible
3. Ensure that @splinetool/react-spline is properly installed
